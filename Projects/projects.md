## Altamira Rocket
Over the 2024 summer, I took on this project as a way to prepare for my role as the CU SRL Avionics Lead.

### Altamira Requirements
The main purpose of this project is to focus on the avionics, and to make it as close to the SRL board as possible. This meant using the BeagleBone Black microcontroller and NASA's FPrime embedded systems framework. The rocket should be able therefore to house these components, as well as return them to the ground safely.

### Altamira Design
To fulfill these requirements, I designed a 3" diameter low-powered rocket. The fins, nosecone, and AV bay are custom designed to be 3D printed. Design was informed by calculations done in OpenRocket
